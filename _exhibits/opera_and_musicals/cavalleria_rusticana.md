act-brief: |
  _**Act I**_ - In a easter morning, in a 19th-century Sicilian village.  
  The story takes place in front of a tavern in a square in the Sicilian countryside. Lucia learns that her son Turiddu has betrayed his wife Santuzza and has made love to Lola, the wife of the driver Alfio. Santuzza persuaded him to correct his evil, but he refused, and still walked into the church with the flamboyant Lola. Santuzza had to tell Alfio that Lola had hooked up with her husband. Alfio challenges Turiddu, and the two sides agree to a duel. Turiddu came to bid farewell to her mother Lucia, and asked her to treat Santuzza like a mother, and left. After that, Santuzza came to Luzia, hugged the poor old woman and started crying... At this time, a woman came from a distance shouting loudly -- "They killed Turiddu!" Santuzza suddenly fainted to the ground (wikipedia, 2021).  
transition: "There are three reasons for the success of this work - First, it chose real-life themes that reflect the lives of ordinary people and left a deep impression on people; second, the music description is extremely wild, and the lyrics and music are also combined very tight, so that the plot and music coordinate very well; last but not least, all the music in the play adopts the beautiful melody in Italian style, which makes the musical talent of Mascagni fully revealed in this work. Let's see the premiere of this talented musicals..."
