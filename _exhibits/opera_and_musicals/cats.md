act-brief: |
  "Act I - The midnight dance will make cats crazy
  After the overture, a group of cats called Jellicles gathered on the stage to describe themselves in turn, and points out that cats have three names: the name used daily in the family, a more elegant name and a secret name. When the leader Deuteronomy arrived, the cat family performed a play for him. In this way, the Jellicle Ball began as scheduled, and all the cats danced and celebrated.

  Act II - Why Will the Summer Day Delay – When Will Time Flow Away?
  The evil Macavity kidnapped the old Deuteronomy and dressed him as the old Deuteronomy. The cats all call him "Napoleon of Crime." After Macavity was exposed, he fought with Munkustrap and Alonz. The scene became very chaotic. Later, the magician Mr. Mistoffelees was asked him to use magic to retrieve the leader. The time has come for the old Deuteronomy to decide which Jellic cat will be reborn -- Grizabella was chosen as the cat who went to the Ninth Heaven and was reborn!
  The Jellik party is coming to an end, and old Deuteronomy tells the human bystander dressed as a cat. In terms of its unique qualities and differences, "cats are very similar to you".

  "Cats is an extremely popular and successful mucisal which produced in 40 years ago. It was adapted by the playwright Lloyd Webber based on the poem written by T. S. Eliot for children. Webber paid full attention to the preference of children. Therefore, the musical \"Cats\" is more popular with children. It held the record as London's longest-running musical from 1989, and in 8 October 2006, it was even surpassed by Les Misérables (wikipedia, 2021)!
  In addition, a major feature of Cats is that each cat on the stage has its own name and character, which is not common in other musicals.
