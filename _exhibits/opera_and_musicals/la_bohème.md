synopsis: |
  "A sad love story of Rodolfo and Mimì. When the penniless poet Rodolfo met the tailor Mimì, they immediately fell in love. But when Rodolfo learned that Mimì was seriously ill, their happiness is threatened.
  Rodolfo realized painfully that he could not afford the medicine and care Mimì needed, so he separated from her. When she was seriously ill, Mimì returned to Rudolph's attic. They were reunited happily--but, despite the care of Rudolph and his friends, Mimì died (eno.org, 2021)."

transition: "This may be the most famous work in the opera and also one of the most popular one. Even more than 100 years later, Puccini’s La Bohème is still one of the most frequently performed works in the world.
Puccini’s opera of love, life and loss have inspired musicals, films and even cartoons. Let's turn our attention back to the very first and most famous performance of Puccini’s La bohème..."
